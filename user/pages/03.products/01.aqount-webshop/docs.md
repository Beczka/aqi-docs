## Use cases

### :fa-lock: Payment authorisation

Authorisation is the fundamental pre-condition to online accept payments via your webshop. Aquont Webshop provides multiple options to manage authorisation depending on your situation, setup and needs.

> **Sample Option A:** Authorisation via our "Payment page": 
We serve as One-Shop-Stop and deal with all communication and integration with the [Payment Service Provider (PSP)](/glossary#psp-payment-service-provider) of your choice. Using our highly customisable API component "Payment page" allows you to easily integrate your webshop with our API to manage all authorisation-relevant business logic in the context of all your payments. 

> **Sample Option B:** Direct PSP authorisation: 
You already have your PSP integration in place or prefer to have a direct connection to the PSP of your choice. Our payment process integrates with your direct authorisation seamlessly.
