title: Business codes
---

Aqount's accounting is based on the concept of so called **business codes**. A **business code** is the combination of the country of a legal entity (specifically from tax perspective) and the relevant currency (e.g. `DE/EUR`, `FR/EUR`, `UK/GBP`). Aqount's month-end- / year-end-reporting is single currencies to prevent currency conversion discrepancies.

> **Country** : The country of registration. If you are registered in different countries and need to provide separate month end reports, we will support this with individual business codes. It is not important where the order is placed, but which tax scheme has to be applied. Therefore the country depends on the registration of your business.

> **Currency** To make sure that the data is not influenced by currency conversions, reporting will be done based on the currency in which we have received the orders.

!!! **Please note**: If a currency or country in which your business is registered is not listed below, please [get in touch with us](/contact-us) and we will create the appropriate business code.
