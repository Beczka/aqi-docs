> **An overview of the steps helping you to get started and using Aqount.**

## Step 1: Get your test account

Get started with Aqount by [requesting your free test account](/registration). Your test account allows you to connect to our API and to play around or to start with your integration. To explore our API, you may want to use the [API Explorer](/api-explorer) to get an overview.

For all further contractual handling, you will be contacted by our team once you signed up for your test account.

!! **TODO:** Clarify the scope of the test account. We may or may not provide more detailed information here about the general features available with the test account.

## Step 2: Start building your integration

Start implementing your integration using your test account. While doing so, you can start working on your [preparation for a live account](/getting-started/overview#step-3-prepare-for-your-live-account). You may want to wait for your configuration details (describing your desired technical setup) to be reviewed and approved before building the whole integration.

Here is a list of potential good starting points to kick-off your integration and to get familiar with Aqount:

* **Golden Client**: Check out our [Golden Client example](./golden-client), which serve to provide you with a full fledged example of an imaginary client running a webshop and using Aqount to manage parts of its business.
* **API Explorer**: In case you want to get an overview of the available endpoints and including all technical details the [API Explorer](/api-explorer) may be the right starting point
* **Use cases**: Depending on your business needs, you may want to start your integration based on one of the following list of use cases
 * **Payments use cases**: Provides a list of [standard use cases related to payments-based services](/payments/use-cases)
 * **Subscriptions use cases**: Provides a list of [standard use cases related to subscriptions-based services](/subscriptions/use-cases)
 * **Accounting use cases**: Provides a list of [standard use cases related to accounting-based services](/accounting/use-cases)

## Step 3: Prepare for your live account

While your test account is fine to play, test and integrate with our API, your live account allows you to consume our API in **LIVE mode**. Due the nature of Aqount and its customisation capabilities, you will have to provide a wide range configuration details which we need to set up your live account.

Here is a check list to help you preparing for a live account:

* Make sure you've been in touch with a [sales contact](/contact-us) for all non-technical contractual topics.
* Follow our [step-by-step instruction guide](/application) to specify all required configuration details by filling out your technical application.
* Send us your technical application for your live account via email to `aqount@arvato.com`.

While you wait for a live account, you can work on your integration using your test account. However, you may want to wait for the result of your application to be confirmed first.

## Step 4: Configure your live account

Once your contract has been signed and your technical application has been approved, you will be provide with your live account details. The details will be send by email to the user who created the test account.

To start consuming our API in  **LIVE mode** using your live account, you will first have to configure it. Use our [Go-Live checklist](/getting-started/go-live-checklist) to make sure to have everything set up correctly.
