## A

### ABA (American Bankers Association) Routing Number
Also referred to as a Routing Transit Number. Directs electronic ACH deposits to the proper financial institution.

### ACH (Automated Clearing House)
The paperless funds transfer system maintained by the Federal Reserve or other entities that have networks to exchange electronic funds transfer items.

### Acquirer
A financial institution that maintains the merchant credit card processing relationship and receives all transactions from the merchant to be distributed to the Cardmember financial institutions.
An acquirer is a bank or financial institution that processes credit or debit card payments on behalf of a merchant. The term acquirer indicates that the bank accepts or acquires credit card payments from the card-issuing banks within an association. An acquiring bank enters into a contract with a merchant and offers it a merchant account. The arrangement provides the merchant with a line of credit. Under the agreement, the acquiring bank exchanges funds with issuing banks on behalf of the merchant, and pays the merchant for its daily payment-card activity's net balance—that is, gross sales minus reversals, interchange fees, and acquirer fees. Interchange fees are fixed rates set by the card association, varying by the merchant's industry. Acquirer fees are an additional markup added to association interchange fees by the acquiring bank, varying at the acquirer's discretion. The acquiring bank accepts the risk that the merchant will remain solvent. The main source of risk to the acquiring bank is fund reversals.
Also see separate Acquirers page.

### ACS (Access Control Server)
Combines access security, authentication, user and administrator access and policy control in a centralized identity framework. Credit card issuers are required to maintain an ACS used to support cardholder authentication.

### Aggregator
An e-commerce business model where the Web store sells products or services which it does not produce or warehouse. An aggregator creates an environment where multiple providers (sellers) must compete on terms determined by the costumer.

### Alternative Payments
Refers to payment methods that are used as an alternative to credit card payments. Most alternative payments have been developed specifically for eCommerce. They can be stored value cards, digital wallets, and other alternative payment methods that are specific to geographic regions and target audiences. The payment systems are generally supported and operated by local banks. Each alternative payment method has its own unique application and settlement process, language and currency support, and is subject to domestic rules and regulations.

### American Express
Provider of credit cards, charge cards and traveler’s check businesses.

### American Express SafeKey
One of the 3-D Secure protocols that works to reduce online fraud by confirming the Cardmember’s identity with an additional password.

### Application programming interface (API)
An application programming interface is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising the interface. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

### Application Service Provider (ASP)
A third-party entity that manages and distributes software-based services and solutions to customers across a wide area network from a central data center.

### Arbitration
The process followed by the card companies to determine whether an Issuer or an Acquirer has ultimate responsibility for a chargeback. Either member initiates this process after the re-presentment process is completed.

### Authentication
The process whereby the actual identity of a party is verified by means of providing secret information to the validating agent. The secret information is assumed to be known only to the party and the validating agent.

### Authorization
The process of verifying that a credit card has sufficient funds to cover the amount of the transaction, also known as pre-authorization (PA). An approval response code is sent to the merchant from the card issuer that verifies availability of credit or funds on the cardholder account.

### Authorization Amount
The amount of a transaction that is submitted to the authorizer for approval. This amount is reserved against the available balance of a customer’s credit card.

### Authorization Code
The code assigned to the transaction once it has been approved by the processor.

### Authorization Only
Transactions of this type are entered and submitted for authorization. These transactions will not be automatically submitted for settlement. In order to capture funds, you must first perform a capture action against the transaction.

### AVS Check (Address Verification Check)
The Address Verification System (AVS) is a system used to verify the address of a person claiming to own a credit card. The system will check the billing address of the credit card provided by the user with the address on file at the credit card company.
Only the first four to five digits of the address and the zip code and the card holder name are verified - everything else IS NOT CHECKED.
Example: Cardholders name and address is Mr. John Doe, 1234 USA Street Realtown, ST 56789. What would be sent to the issuing bank to be checked would be “1234” and “56789”

For VISA and MasterCard this check is only supported for CA, GB and US. Amex and Discover offer this service for all of their cards. The AVS check is known as mandatory but doesn't include the PSPs as the card schemes are doing this check automatically via the data exchange with the issuer.
A full list of all available AVS result codes can be found here. Based on the result codes descision can be made how to treat the authorization, e.g. "reject transaction" or "mark transaction for review".

Within Pay.On you can "remap" codes A, Z, N and U as per screen below. But this is also depending on the fact if the acquirer supports this functionality. For Pay.On Amex and Elavon are enabled for the "remapping" feature.

## B

### Back-end Processor
A data processing company that contracts with Acquirers to provide communication and processing systems that connect with the interchange systems for clearing and settlement services on behalf of those Acquirers. (In some cases the Acquirer may act as its own back-end processor.)

### Bankcard

### Basis Points
A unit of measure used commonly in the financial industry when discussing interest rates and interchange rates where differences of less than one percent are common; one hundredth of a percentage point.

### Batch Processing
Data communications transmission in which transactions are grouped together and transmitted for processing.

### Billbacks
When a merchant processes a transaction, the transaction typically clears at an assigned interchange level (e.g., eCommerce Basic), which is usually the interchange level at which the merchant was priced or at the interchange level where the majority of the transactions typically clear. When a  transaction clears at a different interchange level other than where the merchant is priced, they are charged or credited the difference between the clearing interchange rate and the priced interchange rate.

### BIC
Bank Identifier Code

### BIN (Bank Identification Number)
A unique six-digit number to identify processors, acquirers, issuers and other financial institutions involved in the interchange process; it is the first six digits of the cardholder’s account number. Also known as Issuer Identification Number (IIN).

### Captured/Pending Settlement
Transactions with this status have been approved, captured and are awaiting settlement. These transactions will be submitted for settlement according to the transaction cut off time associated with the merchant account.

### Card Brands
Corporations that connect consumers, businesses and financial institutions to transact through electronic payments instead of cash and checks. Popular brands are MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover.

### Card Scheme
Card schemes are payment networks linked to payment cards, such as debit or credit cards, of which a bank or any other eligible financial institution can become a member. By becoming a member of the scheme, the member then gets the possibility to issue or acquire cards operating on the network of that card scheme.

### Cardholder
A person or entity that is issued a credit or debit account that is accessed through the use of a card.

### Cardholder Authentication Verification Value (CAVV)
Cardholder Authentication Verification Value is generated by the credit card issuer using a complex mathematical algorithm. This value can only be generated by the credit card issuer and can be verified by Visa, MasterCard or by the issuer. The CAVV is used to detect any change in transaction data after the issuer has authorized the transaction.

### Card-not-Present Transactions
Credit or debit card transactions in which the card is not physically present, from the merchant’s perspective, at the time of the actual transaction; e.g. eCommerce (internet) and mail/phone order transactions.

### Chargeback
A bankcard transaction that is under dispute. This action is initiated by the card issuing financial institution to settle a financial claim between the Issuer and Acquirer. This claim may be initiated by the issuing financial institution directly or by their customer, the cardholder, and can result in the transaction being billed back to the merchant.
Chargeback is the return of funds to a consumer forcibly initiated by the issuing bank of the instrument used by a consumer to settle a debt. Specifically, it is the reversal of a prior outbound transfer of funds from a consumer's bank account, line of credit, or credit card. With each chargeback the issuer selects and submits a numeric reason code.

### Chip Cards
Also known as EMV cards. A type of credit/debit card with a computer chip embedded into it. Chip cards make in-person transactions more secure, but make card-notpresent transactions more prone to fraud.

### Clearing
The transfer of data between Issuers and Acquirers.

### Click & Collect
Click & Collect describes the process of a client ordering something online ("click") and picking it up at a physical location, often of his choice ("collect"). This can be the physical outlet of a brand, as well as a drive through pick-up point (such as supermarkets) or a third-party location

### Collecting PSP
The services and business model of a Collecting PSP entail all services of a Classical PSP, but the Collecting PSP enriches his value proposition to the Merchant by a very far-reaching addition: He is part of the money flow between bank, Acquirer or Alternative Payment Method and the Merchant, i.e. the Merchant authorizes the payment methods he is working with to pay the money owed to him to the Collecting PSP instead. The latter consolidates all incoming payment streams from various payment methods, generates a consolidated report and settles in one consolidated amount to the Merchant.

### Communication Error
Transactions of this status experienced an error connecting to the processor. These transactions are not re-submitted or sent for settlement.

### Consumer Authentication (also known as 3D-secure)
The term used to describe tools intended to verify that the person making the transaction is actually the person authorized to do so, in both in-person and card-notpresent transactions.
It is an authentication-service for creditcardtransactions. This service is provided by Visa under the „Verified by Visa“ brand and for MasterCard under the „MasterCard SecureCode“ brand.
Its purpose is the unique identification of the card holder within the check-out process, in order to reduce the fraud risk for customers and the merchants against chargebacks. When activated the 3-D Secure triggers a liability shift towards the card issuing bank. This liability shift does not cover for true chargebacks (e.g. no article received), which are listed in the terms and conditions of the respective acquirer.

### Contactless Payments
Devices that use radio frequency identification for making secure payments. Embedded chip and antenna enable consumer to wave a device over a reader at point of sale.

### Control Number

### Credit/Pending Settlement
Transactions of this status have been entered as credits, but have not yet been submitted for settlement. These transactions will remain in this unsettled state until they are submitted for settlement. Once a credit has been settled, the status changes to Credited.

### Credited
Transactions with this status are refund transactions that have been successfully processed within the system. This refund has been successfully applied against the payment method. No further action may be taken against these transactions.

### Currency Codes
List ISO 4217 currency codes

### CVC2/CVV2 (Card Verification Code and Card Verification Value)
These are terms used by MasterCard and Visa respectively for the codes printed on the cardholder signature panel following the full or partial account number as a security feature. When provided by the cardholder and contained in the authorization record, it allows the issuer to verify the physical presence of the card. Merchant has re-presentment rights and additional protection for specific chargeback codes when issuer approval and authentication of this value occur. Applicable to card-not-present transactions.

### CVV2 Status
This value indicates the level of match between the CVV2 code entered on a transaction and the value that is on file with a customer’s credit card company. A code and narrative description are provided indicating the results returned by the processor.

## D

### Debit Card
Plastic card that gives the cardholder access to their checking account at their financial institution. Transactions (both online and offline) that use a debit card immediately transfer the funds from the checking account associated with the card.

### Declined
Transactions that are not approved are marked as declined. These transactions may not be captured and submitted for settlement.

### Digital Wallets
Digital wallets allow consumers to shop online and pay using a wallet system, rather than entering a credit card for each purchase. Wallets typically use a user name and PIN or other security device to authenticate the buyer.

### Direct Debit
A direct debit or direct withdrawal is a financial transaction in which one person withdraws funds from another person's bank account. Formally, the person who directly draws the funds ("the payee") instructs his or her bank to collect (i.e., debit) an amount directly from another's ("the payer's") bank account designated by the payer and pay those funds into a bank account designated by the payee. Before the payer's banker will allow the transaction to take place, the payer must have advised the bank that he or she has authorized the payee to directly draw the funds. It is also called pre-authorized debit (PAD) or pre-authorized payment (PAP). After the authorities are set up, the direct debit transactions are usually processed electronically. Direct debits are typically used for recurring payments, such as credit card and utility bills, where the payment amounts vary from one payment to another. However, when the authorization is in place, the circumstances in which the funds are drawn as well as the dates and amounts are a matter of agreement between the payee and payer, with which the bankers are not concerned. In countries where setting up authorization is easy enough, direct debits can also be used for irregular payments, such as for mail order transactions or at a point of sale. The payer can cancel the authorization for a direct debit at any time, and the banker can decline to carry out a debit if the transaction would breach the terms of the bank account out of which payment is to be made, for example if it were to cause the account to overdraw.

The legislative topics of this directive in Germany are rolled out with the Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz (ZAG).

### PSP (Payment Service Provider)
Company that provides merchants the ability to accept electronic payments. PSPs can connect to financial institutions, card and payment networks and manage relationships with them as a service to merchants.

A classical PSP offers shops online services for accepting electronic payments by a variety of payment methods including credit card, bank-based payments such as direct debit, bank transfer, and real-time bank transfer based on online banking. Typically, they use a software as a service model and form a single payment gateway for their clients (merchants) to multiple payment methods. A PSP can connect to multiple acquiring banks, card, and payment networks. In many cases, the PSP will fully manage these technical connections, relationships with the external network, and bank accounts. This makes the merchant less dependent on financial institutions and free from the task of establishing these connections directly, especially when operating internationally. Furthermore, by negotiating bulk deals they can often offer cheaper fees. Examples are: Pay.On, WorldPay, AltaPay, CyberSource etc.

## R

Clerical: Duplicate billing, incorrect amount billed, or refund never issued.
Quality: Consumer claims to have never received the goods as promised at the time of purchase.
Fraud: Consumer claims they did not authorize the purchase or identity theft.

### Reconciliation

### Universal Cardholder Authentication Field (UCAF)
Developed by MasterCard for use in their SecureCode payment initiative, UCAF is a universal, multipurpose data transport mechanism implemented by merchants and acquirers for collecting authentication information generated by issuers and cardholders. Once collected, this information is communicated to the issuer in the payment authorization request and provides explicit evidence that the transaction was originated by a legitimate cardholder.

### Upselling / Cross-selling
Upselling is a sales technique whereby a seller induces the customer to purchase more expensive items, upgrades or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered. A different technique is cross-selling in which a seller tries to sell something else. In practice, large businesses usually combine upselling and cross-selling to maximize profit. In doing so, an organization must ensure that its relationship with the client is not disrupted. 

## V

### Verified by Visa 
This is a program offered by Visa to increase security and reduce fraud on internet-initiated purchases. One of the 3-D Secure protocols.
